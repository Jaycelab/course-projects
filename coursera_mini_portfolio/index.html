            Our lab-grown diamonds are sourced from various suppliers with
            sustainability in mind and we are the ONLY fully accredited jeweller
            specializing in lab-grown diamonds. Once the design has been
            approved and finalized, the jewellery pieces get sent to our
            experienced jewellers for them to work their craft in creating your
            perfect jewellery piece. Once completed, we personally pick up the
            jewellery pieces directly from our experienced jewellers, bring them
            back in store and prepare them for pickup.
