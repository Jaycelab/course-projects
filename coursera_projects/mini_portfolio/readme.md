<!-- grid based for flexbox layout
two rows for main content
full-width column for first row of main content
three columns for second row
two half-width colums for footer 

Let's start with the visual layout. The web page should have the company
logo at the top of the page with a navigation menu underneath. The main content of the page should
be below the navigation menu. At the bottom of the page is the footer. The navigation menu requires four
links to be laid out horizontally. 

One link must be to the homepage you are developing depending on the client
persona you've chosen. The other links can be to product pages,
contact forms or company information pages. The main content should feature a large
banner that links to the client's current promotional offer below
the promotional banner. 

There are three columns. Each column should contain an image followed by a heading and some text. Again, depending on the client you choose. 
These can contain offerings or information about the client. The footer is split into two columns. The left column will contain a small
version of the client logo and the right column will contain copyright text. 

You should use the header element for the logo, the nav element for the navigation, the main element for
the main content and the footer element for the footer of the page. 

The next step is to plan your grid layout for the main content and footer for these parts of the web page, you can use
either a CSS grid or a flex box layout. You'll need a full with column
and three columns for the main content. To simplify the main content. Consider splitting the content into
two rows then to half with columns for the footer. 

One last note, it's important to plan your units of measurement when defining your CSS rules and
properties. It will be easier to maintain and debug your CSS if your units
are consistent throughout the code as you learned earlier in the course, choosing
a unit such as M or rem.
